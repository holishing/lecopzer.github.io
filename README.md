# [NCKUClassWeb](http://nckuclass.5gb.co/)

The NCKU Class is a website which the main function is virtual timetable for NCKU students.

It's coded with only Html, CSS, Javascript and a few Jquery. Hoping that everyone can join the project quickly.


## Characteristics

  - Fast : There is no server side involved when user acts on the website, so no delay for waiting server.
  - Easy to understand : We almost don't need any extra guides to tell users how to use.


## Development Environment

	- Ubuntu 15.10 + LAMP (apache, MySQL, PHP)
	- Windows + XAMPP
	- or other environment can build

## XML Parser

	Parser is coded two year ago, and it's horror.
	I would put on another repo after rewriting it.

## future
	
	Make the website not only a virtaul timetable, but also extended with other functions like searching, message board and etc.
	Imporve UI, make the website looks professional.
